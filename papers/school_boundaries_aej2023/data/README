These STATA data files contain 2010 population estimates for 2013-14 school attendance boundaries and for minimum-distance counterfactual boundaries, as described in the paper. The school-level files are unique by NCES school id and provide population counts by race and ethnicity, as well as counts of the population under 185% of the 2010 Federal Poverty Line. School-level files are split by grade level: primary, middle, and high (as defined in the NCES Common Core of Data). The files include a variable for mean distance between census block centroids and school locations, a proxy for commuting distance between homes and schools. 

The district level files are aggregations of the school level files, reporting levels of racial and ethnic segregation in each district, as measured by the variance ratio and dissimilarity index. Levels of segregation are reported for 2013-14 SABs, for their minimum-distance (Voronoi) boundaries based on real school locations, and for Voronoi boundaries based on random school locations (mean segregation after 1000s random draws of school locations). Segregatio indices are measured and reported separately for each racial group (describing separation of one racial group from all others), and also specifically for black-white and hispanic-white separation.
